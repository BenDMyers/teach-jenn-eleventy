# Teach Jenn Eleventy â€” Pet Showcase Site

We're showcasing the pets of Teach Jenn Tech on a shiny new [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) site! This project is pretty empty to start, because we want to show how with Eleventy, you don't need to have a bunch of boilerplate to start building!

## Setup

1. Fork the repo by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Navigate to your repo in your terminal, and run `npm install`.

## Credits

Inspiration for this site comes from [Mike Aparicio's](https://www.mikeaparicio.com/) site [Dogs of Dev](https://dogsof.dev/), which is also built with Eleventy! Go check it out!
